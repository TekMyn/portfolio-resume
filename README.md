## About Me
I’m a Backend & Data Engineer who builds ETL pipelines, backend APIs, automations, and multi-chain blockchain data workflows.  
I use Python, SQL, and cloud tools to turn messy data and repetitive tasks into clean, automated systems.  
I focus on reliability, performance, and creating tools that help teams work faster and smarter.


## Core Strengths
- Building ETL pipelines and data processing systems  
- Designing and maintaining internal APIs  
- Creating automation bots and workflow tools  
- Working with blockchain data (BTC, ETH, TRX, etc.)  
- Managing high-volume datasets across PostgreSQL, BigQuery, MongoDB  
- Scraping on-chain & off-chain sources  
- Building internal dashboards/tools (Retool, GCP, automation frameworks)  
- Writing clean, maintainable, production-ready Python
